# Definition of Done

1.  The code is well understood (another team member has reviewed the code and accepts it).
2.  The code needs to be committed to the appropriate feature branch.
3.  The code must come with automated tests that achieve at least 80% line coverage.
4.  The code in the feature branch must be inspected by another team member before accepting a pull-request to merge into the “develop” branch.
